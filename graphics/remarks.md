Some comments on the systematics of the networks
------------------------------------------------

We are looking for D4-nD0 bound states.

n=1 to n=4
----------

The networks work as expected. Everything works perfectly.

n=5
---

The network `(1,2,1,1)` is marginal problematic. However the problematic intersection coincides with
an expected intersection, so this is could still be fine.

n=6 
---

* The network `(1,1,2,1,1)` shows the same anomaly as `(1,2,1,1)` what is expected since wrapping an extra
(++/--) on the outside is kind of a trivial operation. \\
* The network `(1,2,1,1,1)`is truely anomalous. One may expect to get different networks
when appropriately resolving these new intersections.
* The network `(1,2,1,2)` is anomalous as well. We should study resolutions of these anomalies.

n=7
---

* The anomalous networks from n=6 just carry over by wrapping an extra (++/--). This gives us the anomalous networks
  - (1,1,1,2,1,1)
  - (1,1,2,1,1,1)
  - (1,1,2,1,2)
  
one expects that resolutions carry over as well. 

* The non-anomalous networks will stay non-anomalous after wrapping another "trivial" loop. 
Hence the following networks are expected to be non-anomalous:
  - (1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
  - (1,1,1,1,1,2)
  - (1,1,1,1,2,1)
  - (1,1,1,2,2)
  - (1,1,2,2,1)
  - (1,1,2,3)

* The remaining, truely new networks are:
  - (1,2,1,1,2) -> anomalous.
  - (1,2,1,2,1) -> anomalous.
  - (1,2,2,1,1) -> marginal.
  - (1,2,2,2) -> nice.
